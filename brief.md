# Project Brief: Browser-Based Walkie-Talkie AppProject Brief: Browser-Based Walkie-Talkie App

	1.	Project Overview

## 1. Project OverviewThe goal is to build a real-time, browser-based walkie-talkie that allows small groups (up to 15 users) to communicate via push-to-talk (PTT) audio. Users connect via a URL, press a button to speak, and hear audio from others instantly.



A real-time, browser-based walkie-talkie application that enables instant voice communication via push-to-talk (PTT). Users connect through 5-digit channel codes for secure, isolated communication without requiring accounts or downloads.Key Features:

	â€¢	Push-to-talk audio communication

### Key Features:	â€¢	Real-time streaming with minimal latency

- Push-to-talk audio communication with visual feedback	â€¢	Room-based grouping

- Channel-based grouping (00001-99999)	â€¢	Cross-platform: desktop, mobile, tablet

- Real-time streaming with minimal latency (~30-90ms)	â€¢	Secure communication over HTTPS

- Cross-platform: desktop, mobile, tablet	â€¢	Optional TURN server for NAT traversal

- Vintage walkie-talkie inspired interface	â€¢	Scalable to handle ~15 concurrent users per room

- No installation or registration required

Browser <-> Node.js Server + mediasoup SFU <-> Browser

### Deployment:Server handles signaling and forwards audio streams. TURN/STUN ensures connectivity across networks.

- Docker support	4.	Functional Flow

- Render.com ready	5.	User opens room URL

- HTTPS required for production	6.	Client requests RTP capabilities

	7.	Client creates send transport

## 3. Architecture	8.	User presses PTT button (audio captured and sent)

	9.	Server forwards audio to other users

```	10.	Others hear audio in real-time

User Mic â†’ MediaRecorder â†’ Socket.IO â†’ Server â†’ Socket.IO â†’ Other Users â†’ Web Audio API â†’ Speaker	11.	User releases PTT

```	12.	Cleanup on disconnect

	13.	Scalability

**Simplified Design:**

- Direct audio chunk relay via Socket.IO	â€¢	15 audio-only users per room on 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM VPS

- No complex WebRTC signaling required	â€¢	Multiple rooms supported

- Server acts as a simple relay/router	â€¢	Additional mediasoup workers for higher scale

- Rooms are isolated by channel codes

	6.	Security

## 4. Functional Flow

	â€¢	HTTPS (TLS)

1. User opens app and selects 5-digit channel code	â€¢	TURN credentials

2. User clicks "JOIN CHANNEL"	â€¢	Optional authentication

3. Server adds user to room (channel)	â€¢	No persistent recording by default

4. Server sends list of existing peers

5. User presses PTT button	7.	Deployment Plan

6. MediaRecorder captures microphone audio	8.	Deploy Node.js + mediasoup on VPS

7. Audio chunks encoded as Opus/WebM	9.	Configure TLS/HTTPS

8. Binary data sent via Socket.IO to server	10.	Install TURN server (coturn)

9. Server relays audio to all other users in channel	11.	Map domain to server IP

10. Other users decode and play audio	12.	Serve frontend via Express or CDN

11. VU meter shows audio levels during playback	13.	Test multi-device access

12. User releases PTT button	14.	Optional monitoring

13. Recording stops and final audio transmitted	15.	Key Challenges & Solutions

14. PTT re-enables for other users| Challenge | Solution |

|â€”â€”â€”â€“|â€”â€”â€”|

## 5. Scalability| NAT/firewall | TURN server |

| Multiple users | SFU (mediasoup) |

**Current Implementation:**| Latency | Audio-only Opus codec |

- Lightweight relay architecture| Security | HTTPS + TURN credentials |

- Multiple isolated channels/rooms| Browser compatibility | Test across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari |

- ~10-20 users per channel recommended	16.	Future Enhancements

- Minimal server resources required

- Horizontal scaling via multiple instances	â€¢	Improved PTT UI

	â€¢	Multi-room routing

## 6. Security	â€¢	Optional recording/transcription

	â€¢	Mobile-optimized layout

- HTTPS/TLS in production (required for mic access)	â€¢	Integration with chat or workflow systems

- Channel-based isolation (no cross-channel leaks)

- No persistent storage or recording	10.	Project Completion Checklist

- Optional: Add authentication layer

- Optional: Channel password protection	â€¢	Backend with Socket.io signaling

	â€¢	Mediasoup SFU

## 7. Deployment Plan	â€¢	Frontend PTT button

	â€¢	STUN/TURN integration

1. Build webpack bundle (`npm run build`)	â€¢	Room creation/joining

2. Deploy to Render.com (auto-configured via render.yaml)	â€¢	HTTPS deployment plan

3. Or deploy to any Node.js hosting platform	â€¢	Tested with 15 users
